<h1 class="abouth1">Just us</h1>

<p class="palabout">Shayari Da Maja is a place where words turn into emotions and poetry finds a beautiful home.</p>
    <p class="palabout">We created this platform for people who love expressing feelings through shayari — be it love, sadness, happiness, motivation, or life itself.</p>
    
   <p class="palabout"> Shayari has always been more than just words for us. It reflects our thoughts, our inner voice, and moments we sometimes struggle to express. At Shayari Da Maja, we believe every emotion deserves words, and every person deserves a space to share them.</p>
    
   <p class="palabout">Our goal is to provide a simple and welcoming platform where users can write, read, edit, and share their own shayaris freely. Whether you are a beginner trying poetry for the first time or someone who has always loved writing, this space is for you.</p>
    
   <p class="palabout"> We focus on creating a clean, easy-to-use, and beautiful experience so you can concentrate on what really matters — your words. No complexity, no distractions, just pure expression.</p>
    
    <p class="palabout">Thank you for being a part of Shayari Da Maja.</br>
    ✨ Write your heart. Share your thoughts. Feel the words. ✨</p>
